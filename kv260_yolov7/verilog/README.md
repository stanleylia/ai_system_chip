# Verilog Design Notes

This folder is intended for RTL modules written in Verilog/SystemVerilog.
You can follow the workflow described in `YOLO-on-PYNQ-Z2/DPU implementation`
to integrate the accelerator with the KV260 platform.

Use this space to store source files, constraints and Vivado project scripts.
