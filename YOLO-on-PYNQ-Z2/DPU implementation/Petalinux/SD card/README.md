# SD Card files
These two files (image.ub and BOOT.BIN) are meant to be flashed on the BOOT partition of the SD card. All the instructions are on the [sub-chapter SD Card files](https://github.com/andre1araujo/YOLO-on-PYNQ-Z2/tree/main/DPU%20implementation#sd-card-files) on the DPU Implementation.

The **rootfs.tar.gz** compressed file cannot be found here because of it's large dimensions. Instead, I made it available on this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yFBamnW9IZ8Q5byI6S1dtcRflEHAwzsj/view?usp=sharing) in case you need it.

Thank you for understanding! :)
